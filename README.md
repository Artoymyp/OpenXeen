          ---- OpenXeen -----

OpenXeen is a mod for Might and Magic IV & V - World of Xeen (WOX), programmed by duuckman (Dr Warren Creemers).
It is a game engine rewrite in java designed to make MaM gaming more available.

Unfortunately, MaM is not abandonware - you (still) need to purchase a copy to play the full version of WOX legally.
This mod aims to bundle the shareware version, but I recommend finding a full CD (talkie) version on ebay.

The game mechanics, and engine, are based on things I would have liked to see done differently:
    - Less save/restore loops for potions/barrels/treasure chests.
    - Better inventory at stores.
    - More money in the later part of the game.
    - Monster respawn.
    - Bat animation relative to level of danger.
    - Item stats just printed/explained.
    - Restrictions on when you can save/load games.
    - One open map, not divided into regions.
    - Bigger 3d view window


NB: OpenXeen is programmed in java because I needed a project to "freshen" up
    my java skills and learn java 8. No other reason.
